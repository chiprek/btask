Btask - a project management tool. 

"Install": git clone the repo.
set up venv with textual. ( I use uv as that is what I learned to use.)

run with "uv run \_\_main\_\_.py"

will eventually figure out how to package this in a more portable way. 

this application is not meant to be serious as this is more of a snarky response to my empoylers quality assurance team thinking a machine needed something that it was never speced for.

if you are looking to do similar things by all means use this as a refrence. ive been fumbling through figuring this framework out.
